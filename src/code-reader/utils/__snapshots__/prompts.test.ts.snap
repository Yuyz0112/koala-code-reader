File Structure:
No files available
</AnalysisContext>

<Task>
**CRITICAL CONSTRAINT**: You MUST select a file that exists in the provided file structure above. Do NOT create or suggest any file paths that are not explicitly listed in the file structure.


Based on the provided context, determine the most logical entry file to start the code analysis from the files that are available in the repository. Consider:

1. **File Existence**: The selected file MUST be present in the file structure above
2. **Main Goal Alignment**: Which available file would best serve the stated analysis goal?
3. **Entry Points**: Look for typical entry points among the existing files:
   - Main application files (index.js, main.ts, app.ts, etc.)
   - Configuration files that reveal architecture
   - Key domain/business logic files
   - Files that might be mentioned in package.json scripts
4. **Specific Areas**: If specific areas are mentioned, prioritize existing files related to those areas
5. **Project Structure**: Consider the project type and common patterns among available files

**VALIDATION REQUIREMENT**: Before suggesting any file path, verify that the exact path exists in the file structure provided above.

If the current information is insufficient to make a confident decision about which existing file to start with, ask for clarification.
</Task>

<OutputFormat>
**Every response MUST consist solely of valid YAML that conforms exactly to the schema below—no extra text, explanations, or comments.**

Reason for analyzing this file: Entry point
</CurrentScenario>

<FileContent>
File: index.ts
\`\`\`

<Instructions>
1. **Analyze the file content** thoroughly to understand its purpose, key functionality, and role
2. **Provide your analysis and understanding** of what this file does and why it's important
3. **Propose the next logical file** to analyze based on your understanding

**CRITICAL ANALYSIS PRINCIPLES**:

1. **HIGH-CONFIDENCE SELECTION ONLY**: Only propose to read a file if you have HIGH CONFIDENCE (>80%) that it is directly relevant to the current user task and main goal. Do not propose files for exploratory purposes or "just to see what's there."

2. **NO REDUNDANT READING**: Never propose to re-read files that are already listed in the Analysis History. Those files have been completely analyzed and their understanding is already captured in the summaries above.

3. **TARGETED ANALYSIS**: Before proposing the next file, clearly articulate why that specific file is essential for understanding the main goal. Avoid generic reasoning like "to understand the project better" - be specific about what gap in understanding this file will fill.

4. **EFFICIENCY OVER COMPLETENESS**: It's better to analyze fewer, highly relevant files thoroughly than to read many files with marginal relevance. Focus on the files that are most critical to achieving the main goal.

Focus on understanding the codebase incrementally, but only when there's clear justification for reading additional files.

**Important**: Consider the analysis history and main goal to determine if you have sufficient understanding. If you believe you have analyzed enough files to achieve the main goal and understand the key aspects of the codebase, you should complete the analysis rather than continuing indefinitely.

**CRITICAL CONSTRAINT**: You MUST select a file that exists in the provided file structure above. Do NOT create or suggest any file paths that are not explicitly listed in the file structure.


Based on the provided context, determine the most logical entry file to start the code analysis from the files that are available in the repository. Consider:

1. **File Existence**: The selected file MUST be present in the file structure above
2. **Main Goal Alignment**: Which available file would best serve the stated analysis goal?
3. **Entry Points**: Look for typical entry points among the existing files:
   - Main application files (index.js, main.ts, app.ts, etc.)
   - Configuration files that reveal architecture
   - Key domain/business logic files
   - Files that might be mentioned in package.json scripts
4. **Specific Areas**: If specific areas are mentioned, prioritize existing files related to those areas
5. **Project Structure**: Consider the project type and common patterns among available files

**VALIDATION REQUIREMENT**: Before suggesting any file path, verify that the exact path exists in the file structure provided above.

If the current information is insufficient to make a confident decision about which existing file to start with, ask for clarification.

**If you can identify an entry file:**

  name: "path/to/file.ext"     # string - MUST be an exact file path from the file structure above
  reason: "Brief explanation"   # string - why this existing file is the best starting point

**If you need more information:**
\`\`\`yaml
decision: need_more_info
ask_user: "Specific question about what additional information you need"  # string
\`\`\`
</OutputFormat>

**REMINDER**: Only suggest file paths that are explicitly listed in the file structure above. Do not invent or assume any file paths.
