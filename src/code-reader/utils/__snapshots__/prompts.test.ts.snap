Main Goal: Learn


File Structure:
No files available
</AnalysisContext>

<Task>
**CRITICAL CONSTRAINT**: You MUST select a file that exists in the provided file structure above. Do NOT create or suggest any file paths that are not explicitly listed in the file structure.


Based on the provided context, determine the most logical entry file to start the code analysis from the files that are available in the repository. Consider:

1. **File Existence**: The selected file MUST be present in the file structure above
2. **Main Goal Alignment**: Which available file would best serve the stated analysis goal?
3. **Entry Points**: Look for typical entry points among the existing files:
   - Main application files (index.js, main.ts, app.ts, etc.)
   - Configuration files that reveal architecture
   - Key domain/business logic files
   - Files that might be mentioned in package.json scripts
4. **Specific Areas**: If specific areas are mentioned, prioritize existing files related to those areas
5. **Project Structure**: Consider the project type and common patterns among available files

**VALIDATION REQUIREMENT**: Before suggesting any file path, verify that the exact path exists in the file structure provided above.

If the current information is insufficient to make a confident decision about which existing file to start with, ask for clarification.
</Task>

<OutputFormat>
**Every response MUST consist solely of valid YAML that conforms exactly to the schema below—no extra text, explanations, or comments.**

**If you can identify an entry file:**
\`\`\`yaml
decision: entry_file_found
next_file:
  name: "path/to/file.ext"     # string - MUST be an exact file path from the file structure above
  reason: "Brief explanation"   # string - why this existing file is the best starting point
\`\`\`

**If you need more information:**
\`\`\`yaml
decision: need_more_info
ask_user: "Specific question about what additional information you need"  # string
\`\`\`
</OutputFormat>

**REMINDER**: Only suggest file paths that are explicitly listed in the file structure above. Do not invent or assume any file paths.

Analyze the codebase structure and provide your decision:"

Reason for analyzing this file: Entry point
</CurrentScenario>

<FileContent>
File: index.ts
\`\`\`
const x = 1;
\`\`\`
</FileContent>

<Instructions>
1. **Analyze the file content** thoroughly to understand its purpose, key functionality, and role
2. **Focus on what you can understand from this file alone** - don't worry about incomplete understanding due to external dependencies
3. **Record any dependencies or references** to other files/components that would need further investigation
4. **Provide your analysis and understanding** of what this file does and why it's important
5. **Propose the next logical file** to analyze - MUST choose from "AVAILABLE FILES FOR NEXT ANALYSIS" section above

**CRITICAL ANALYSIS PRINCIPLES**:

1. **NEXT FILE MUST BE FROM PENDING LIST**: Your next_filename MUST be exactly one of the files marked "○ [FILE] ... (PENDING)" from "AVAILABLE FILES FOR NEXT ANALYSIS" section.

2. **FOCUS ON CURRENT FILE**: Analyze the current file's content thoroughly, even if some parts depend on other files. Record dependencies and incomplete understanding in your analysis - the final writer will cross-reference multiple files to complete the picture.

3. **RECORD DEPENDENCIES**: When you encounter references to other files, interfaces, or components not fully defined in the current file, note them in your analysis rather than trying to resolve them immediately.

4. **HIGH-CONFIDENCE SELECTION ONLY**: Only propose to read a file if you have HIGH CONFIDENCE (>80%) that it is directly relevant to the current user task and main goal.

5. **NO REDUNDANT READING**: Never propose files that appear in BackgroundContext - those are already analyzed.

6. **TARGETED ANALYSIS**: Be specific about what gap in understanding the chosen file will fill.

7. **EFFICIENCY OVER COMPLETENESS**: Focus on files most critical to achieving the main goal.

4. **Provide your analysis and understanding** of what this file does and why it's important
5. **Propose the next logical file** to analyze - MUST choose from "AVAILABLE FILES FOR NEXT ANALYSIS" section above

**ANALYSIS FOCUS GUIDELINES**:

- **Current File Priority**: Your primary focus should be understanding what the current file implements, defines, and contributes to the system
- **Dependencies as Notes**: When you encounter imports, interfaces, or references to other files, record them as dependencies rather than trying to fully understand them
- **Incomplete Understanding is OK**: It's acceptable to have partial understanding due to external dependencies - note these gaps in your analysis
- **Final Assembly**: Remember that the final writer will have access to all analyzed files and can cross-reference to complete the understanding
- **Avoid Speculation**: Don't guess about external implementations - focus on what you can directly observe in the current file

Focus on understanding the codebase incrementally, but only when there's clear justification for reading additional files.

**Important**: Consider the analysis history and main goal to determine if you have sufficient understanding. If you believe you have analyzed enough files to achieve the main goal and understand the key aspects of the codebase, you should complete the analysis rather than continuing indefinitely.

- **Incomplete Understanding is OK**: It's acceptable to have partial understanding due to external dependencies - note these gaps in your analysis
- **Final Assembly**: Remember that the final writer will have access to all analyzed files and can cross-reference to complete the understanding
- **Avoid Speculation**: Don't guess about external implementations - focus on what you can directly observe in the current file

Focus on understanding the codebase incrementally, but only when there's clear justification for reading additional files.

**Important**: Consider the analysis history and main goal to determine if you have sufficient understanding. If you believe you have analyzed enough files to achieve the main goal and understand the key aspects of the codebase, you should complete the analysis rather than continuing indefinitely.

<Instructions>
1. **Analyze the file content** thoroughly to understand its purpose, key functionality, and role
2. **Focus on what you can understand from this file alone** - don't worry about incomplete understanding due to external dependencies
3. **Record any dependencies or references** to other files/components that would need further investigation
4. **Provide your analysis and understanding** of what this file does and why it's important
5. **Propose the next logical file** to analyze - MUST choose from "AVAILABLE FILES FOR NEXT ANALYSIS" section above

**CRITICAL ANALYSIS PRINCIPLES**:

1. **NEXT FILE MUST BE FROM PENDING LIST**: Your next_filename MUST be exactly one of the files marked "○ [FILE] ... (PENDING)" from "AVAILABLE FILES FOR NEXT ANALYSIS" section.

2. **FOCUS ON CURRENT FILE**: Analyze the current file's content thoroughly, even if some parts depend on other files. Record dependencies and incomplete understanding in your analysis - the final writer will cross-reference multiple files to complete the picture.

3. **RECORD DEPENDENCIES**: When you encounter references to other files, interfaces, or components not fully defined in the current file, note them in your analysis rather than trying to resolve them immediately.

4. **HIGH-CONFIDENCE SELECTION ONLY**: Only propose to read a file if you have HIGH CONFIDENCE (>80%) that it is directly relevant to the current user task and main goal.

5. **NO REDUNDANT READING**: Never propose files that appear in BackgroundContext - those are already analyzed.

6. **TARGETED ANALYSIS**: Be specific about what gap in understanding the chosen file will fill.

7. **EFFICIENCY OVER COMPLETENESS**: Focus on files most critical to achieving the main goal.
