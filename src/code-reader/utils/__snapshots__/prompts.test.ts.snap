<Task>
Based on the provided context, determine the most logical entry file to start the code analysis. Consider:

1. **Main Goal Alignment**: Which file would best serve the stated analysis goal?
2. **Entry Points**: Look for typical entry points like:
   - Main application files (index.js, main.ts, app.ts, etc.)
   - Configuration files that reveal architecture
   - Key domain/business logic files
   - Files mentioned in package.json scripts
3. **Specific Areas**: If specific areas are mentioned, prioritize files related to those areas
4. **Project Structure**: Consider the project type and common patterns

If the current information is insufficient to make a confident decision, ask for clarification.

4. **Propose the next logical file** that builds upon this refined understanding

**CRITICAL ANALYSIS PRINCIPLES**:

1. **HIGH-CONFIDENCE SELECTION ONLY**: Only propose to read a file if you have HIGH CONFIDENCE (>80%) that it is directly relevant to the current user task and main goal. Do not propose files for exploratory purposes or "just to see what's there."

2. **NO REDUNDANT READING**: Never propose to re-read files that are already listed in the Analysis History. Those files have been completely analyzed and their understanding is already captured in the summaries above.

3. **TARGETED ANALYSIS**: Before proposing the next file, clearly articulate why that specific file is essential for understanding the main goal. Avoid generic reasoning like "to understand the project better" - be specific about what gap in understanding this file will fill.

4. **EFFICIENCY OVER COMPLETENESS**: It's better to analyze fewer, highly relevant files thoroughly than to read many files with marginal relevance. Focus on the files that are most critical to achieving the main goal.

Focus on understanding the codebase incrementally, but only when there's clear justification for reading additional files.

**Important**: Consider the analysis history and main goal to determine if you have sufficient understanding. If you believe you have analyzed enough files to achieve the main goal and understand the key aspects of the codebase, you should complete the analysis rather than continuing indefinitely.

**CRITICAL**: You must provide a COMPLETE, FULLY INTEGRATED analysis that combines the previous reduced output with the new information. Do NOT provide incremental updates or partial content.

Your task is to create a comprehensive, unified analysis that includes:

1. **Start with the previous reduced output** as your foundation
2. **Incorporate the current file's analysis** seamlessly into the existing understanding  
3. **Merge and synthesize** all information into ONE coherent, complete analysis
4. **Maintain all important insights** from the previous output while adding new findings
5. **Focus on the main goal** throughout the entire consolidated analysis
6. **Create a flowing narrative** that tells the complete story of the codebase understanding so far

**Important**: The output should be a COMPLETE analysis that someone could read independently to understand the entire codebase analysis progress, not just the latest update. Think of it as rewriting the entire analysis document with the new information included.
</Task>

<OutputFormat>
**Every response MUST consist solely of valid YAML that conforms exactly to the schema below窶馬o extra text, explanations, or comments.**
